# Azure-Lab-Portfolio-AZ104

Welcome to my **Azure Lab Portfolio for AZ-104 **. This repository contains **number** hands-on labs that I have personally completed to practice and demonstrate skills required for the **Microsoft AZ-104: Azure Administrator Associate** certification and real-world Azure administration tasks.

All labs were completed using my **own Azure subscription**, combining **Azure Portal**, **PowerShell**, and, where applicable, **ARM templates (JSON)** or **Bicep** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Each lab includes **screenshots, scripts, diagrams, and step-by-step documentation** to show that the work was done by myself.
