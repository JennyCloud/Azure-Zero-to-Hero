# ☁️ Microsoft Azure Multi-Hour Outage — February 2026

In early February 2026, **Microsoft Azure** experienced a major, multi-region service outage lasting over **ten hours**.  

The disruption impacted **virtual machine (VM) lifecycle operations**, **managed identities**, and **developer workflows** across several regions.  

Microsoft later confirmed that the root cause was a **misconfiguration in Azure’s storage-policy infrastructure**, which affected access to **Microsoft-managed storage accounts** used by Azure control-plane services.
