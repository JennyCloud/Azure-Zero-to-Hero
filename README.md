# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Zero to Hero ‚Äî Cloud Learning Portfolio  
**Author:** Jenny Wang (@JennyCloud)  
**Focus:** Building, automating, and troubleshooting Azure infrastructure with real-world, MSP-style scenarios.

---

## üß≠ Overview
This repository documents my end-to-end Azure learning journey ‚Äî from hybrid networking and load balancing to certification-focused labs and daily troubleshooting practice.  
Each folder represents a structured learning path combining **hands-on deployment**, **PowerShell automation**, and **professional documentation**.

I designed these labs to mirror the tasks of a **junior cloud administrator** or **MSP engineer** ‚Äî focusing on uptime, resilience, and reproducibility rather than just theory.
