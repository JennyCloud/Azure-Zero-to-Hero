# ☁️ Azure Administrator Portfolio  
**Azure Zero to Hero — Hands-on Learning & Real-World Labs**

---

## 👋 Who I Am
I am an Azure learner focused on **cloud administration and operations**, building hands-on experience through production-style labs, automation, and real troubleshooting.  
My goal is to become a dependable Azure administrator who can deploy, secure, and operate cloud environments responsibly.

---

## ⚙️ What I Can Operate
- Azure networking (VNets, Load Balancers, Private Endpoints, DNS)
- Identity and access (Microsoft Entra ID, RBAC, managed identities)
- Compute and scaling (VMs, VMSS, App Service)
- Secure service access (Key Vault, private connectivity)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Bicep, ARM, PowerShell, Azure CLI)
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions (OIDC-based authentication)
- Cost-aware resource lifecycle management (deploy → verify → clean up)
