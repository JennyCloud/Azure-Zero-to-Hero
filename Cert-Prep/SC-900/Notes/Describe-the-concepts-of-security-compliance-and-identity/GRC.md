# 🛡️ Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in Microsoft Cloud

## 🧠 What Is GRC?

**GRC** stands for **Governance, Risk, and Compliance**.  
It is a framework used by organizations to **control how technology is used**, **reduce uncertainty**, and **meet legal and regulatory requirements**.

In Microsoft cloud services, GRC helps answer three core questions:
- Are we using resources the right way?
- What could go wrong?
- Are we meeting required rules and standards?

## 🧭 GRC Pillars Explained

### 🏛️ Governance
**Governance** defines **how resources should be used** and **who is allowed to do what**.

It focuses on:
- Policies and standards
- Access control and accountability
- Resource consistency

**Microsoft examples:**
- Azure Policy
- Management Groups
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

➡️ Governance is about **control and direction**.

### ⚠️ Risk
**Risk** is the possibility that a threat or weakness could cause harm to the organization.

Risk management involves:
- Identifying risks
- Assessing likelihood and impact
- Reducing or accepting risk

**Microsoft examples:**
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Secure Score
- Risk-based security recommendations

➡️ Risk is about **reducing uncertainty and exposure**.

---

### 📜 Compliance
**Compliance** ensures the organization **meets laws, regulations, and internal policies**.

This includes:
- Regulatory requirements (ISO, SOC, GDPR)
- Industry standards
- Internal company rules

**Microsoft examples:**
- Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager
- Compliance Score
- Audit and eDiscovery tools

➡️ Compliance is about **proving adherence**.

---

## 🔗 How GRC Works Together

- **Governance** sets the rules
- **Risk** evaluates what could break those rules
- **Compliance** proves the rules are being followed

GRC is not a tool—it is a **continuous process** supported by Microsoft services.

## 🎯 Why GRC Matters

- Explains **why policies and controls exist**
- Connects security with **business and legal accountability**

---

## 🧩 One-Line Summary

**GRC is a framework that helps organizations govern cloud usage, manage security risks, and meet compliance requirements using policies, assessments, and reporting.**
