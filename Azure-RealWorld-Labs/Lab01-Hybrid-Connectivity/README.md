# üß™ Azure Real-World Labs  
## Lab 01 ‚Äì Hybrid Connectivity  
**Author:** Jenny Wang (@JennyCloud)‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Completed:** October 27, 2025  

*Simulating secure site-to-site VPN connectivity between Azure and an on-premises network.*

---

## üéØ Purpose
Create a realistic hybrid network scenario that mirrors how Managed Service Providers (MSPs) link on-premises client infrastructure to Azure using IPsec VPN gateways.  
This lab demonstrates VNet design, gateway deployment, routing, and end-to-end troubleshooting.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview
| Component | Details |
|------------|----------|
| **Azure VNet** | `Azure-VNet` ‚Äì 10.10.0.0/16 with `VMSubnet` and `GatewaySubnet` |
| **On-Prem VNet (Simulated)** | `OnPrem-VNet` ‚Äì 192.168.1.0/24 with `OnPremSubnet` and `GatewaySubnet` |
| **Gateways** | Two route-based VPN gateways (SKU :`VpnGw1`) |
| **Connections** | VNet-to-VNet using shared key `Lab123!SharedKey` |
| **Verification** | Cross-ping between Azure VM and On-Prem VM through VPN tunnel |

---

## üß© Tools Used
- Azure Portal  
- Azure PowerShell (Cloud Shell)  
- Azure Bastion Developer SKU  
- Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (smalldisk image)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps
1. **Resource Group:** Created `HybridLab-RG`.  
2. **Networking:** Built VNets for Azure and On-Prem simulation.  
3. **Gateways:** Deployed static Standard Public IPs and VPN gateways.  
4. **Connections:** Established bidirectional VNet-to-VNet links.  
5. **Verification:** Deployed two Windows VMs and tested cross-ping successfully.

## üîç Issues Encountered & Troubleshooting Record

| Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Public IP creation failed | Dynamic allocation not supported for VPN gateways | Re-created IP with `-Sku Standard -AllocationMethod Static` |
| Invalid subnet reference | Passed VNet ID instead of subnet object | Used `Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig` to fetch subnet object |
| GatewaySubnet too small (/28) | Minimum size for zone-redundant gateway is /27 | Re-created as `192.168.1.224/27` |
| ConnectionStatus blank / Unknown | Only one connection object created | Added reverse connection and reset shared keys |
| Public IP quota exceeded | Free tier limit of 3 IPs per region | Deployed VMs with private IPs only and used Bastion |
| Bastion single-session limit | Developer SKU restriction | Tested sequentially (one VM at a time) |
| Ping failed (100 % loss) | ICMP blocked by firewall and NSG | Enabled ICMP via `netsh` and added NSG rule for `192.168.1.0/24` |

---

## ‚úÖ Results
- **VPN Status:** Connected  
- **Ping Test:** Successful (OnPremTestVM ‚Üí AzureTestVM)  
- **EgressBytesTransferred:** Non-zero values confirm live traffic  
- **Evidence:** All scripts and screenshots in `/scripts` and `/screenshots`

## üß† Knowledge Highlights
| Skill Area | Demonstrated By |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Azure Networking & VPN | `create-vpn-gateway.ps1`, `create-site-to-site.ps1` |
| Infrastructure Automation | Parameterized PowerShell scripts |
| Troubleshooting & Diagnostics | Issue log and stepwise resolution documented above |
| Security & Governance | Minimal exposure design using private IP and NSG rules |

---

## üß© Professional Context
This scenario mirrors MSP operations when onboarding a client‚Äôs on-prem data center to Azure.  
It proves capability in network design, IP planning, VPN configuration, and live troubleshooting under subscription constraints.

---

## üß≠ Lessons Learned
- Always use **Static Standard** Public IPs for gateways.  
- `/27` is the minimum GatewaySubnet size.  
- Two connection objects (one per direction) ensure handshake success.  
- Bastion Developer is adequate for testing‚Äîconnect sequentially.  
- Proper firewall and NSG rules are essential for cross-VNet traffic.

## üöÄ Next Steps
| Planned Lab | Focus Area |
|--------------|------------|
| **Lab 02 ‚Äì Load Balancing & High Availability** | Internal / external load balancers, probes, failover |
| **Lab 03 ‚Äì Storage Security (Planned)** | SAS tokens, RBAC, storage firewalls |
| **Lab 04 ‚Äì Monitoring & Automation (Planned)** | Log Analytics, alerts, auto-remediation |

## üìò Reflection
This lab taught me how to translate Azure networking theory into real deployments,  
debug complex VPN issues using PowerShell,  
and document results systematically ‚Äî skills directly relevant to MSP and Azure Administrator roles.
