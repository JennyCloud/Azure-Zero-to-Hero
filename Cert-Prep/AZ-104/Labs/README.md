# AZ-104 Certification Labs

This folder contains hands-on labs I completed while preparing for the **Microsoft AZ-104: Azure Administrator Associate** exam.  
The labs focus on building real skills across compute, networking, storage, identity, and automation.

Most labs were completed using the **Azure Portal** so I can build confidence with manual configuration and understand how Azure services behave visually.  

For selected scenarios, I also used **automation (Bicep + GitHub Actions)** to practice real-world Infrastructure-as-Code workflows.

**Lab:**  
📌 **[03-Deploy-and-Manage-Azure-Compute-Resources / 01-Automate-Deployment-of-Resources](03-Deploy-and-Manage-Azure-Compute-Resources/01-Automate-Deployment-of-Resources/)**

I chose to complete most labs in the portal first because:
- It builds strong foundational knowledge  
- It’s easier to visualize resources  
- It helps me understand the relationships between Azure services  
- It prepares me for AZ-104 exam questions, which often show Portal screenshots  

Automation skills were already applied in separate labs, which reflects real Azure admin workflow:
1. Learn the service in the portal  
2. Automate it using Bicep/ARM/pipelines
