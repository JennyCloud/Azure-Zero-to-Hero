# Lab 04 – Create and Configure Azure App Service

Azure App Service is basically “Platform-as-a-Service for web apps.” You don’t manage the VM OS, patching, scaling mechanisms, or load balancers. The platform does it. The lab covers everything an admin is expected to touch: plans, scaling, TLS, DNS, backups, networking, and deployment slots.
