# 🛡️ Governance & Audit in Microsoft Security

## 🧭 Governance – Controlling Risk Before It Happens

### 🔎 What is Governance?

Governance is the process of:
- Defining policies
- Managing risk
- Enforcing standards
- Ensuring regulatory compliance

It answers the question:

> “Are we operating securely and according to required rules?”

Governance is proactive.

It focuses on:
- Preventing misconfiguration
- Reducing compliance risk
- Controlling access
- Managing data lifecycle

### 🏗️ Governance in Microsoft Cloud

Examples include:

- **Azure Policy** → Enforces rules (e.g., block public IP creation)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** → Controls who can do what
- **Microsoft Purview** → Data classification and compliance management
- **Compliance Manager** → Tracks regulatory posture (GDPR, ISO, etc.)

Governance ensures the environment is built correctly **from the start**.

## 📜 Audit – Proving What Happened

### 🔎 What is Audit?

Auditing is the process of:
- Recording activities
- Monitoring changes
- Reviewing logs
- Investigating incidents

It answers the question:

> “What happened, when did it happen, and who did it?”

Audit is reactive and evidence-based.

### 📊 Audit in Microsoft Cloud

Examples include:

- **Microsoft Purview Audit (Unified Audit Log)**
- **Azure Monitor Logs**
- **Microsoft Entra ID Sign-in Logs**
- **Security logs in Microsoft Defender**

Auditing provides:
- Traceability
- Accountability
- Forensic evidence
- Compliance reporting

## 🔄 Governance vs Audit (Core Difference)

| Governance | Audit |
|------------|--------|
| Prevents risk | Detects and reviews events |
| Policy enforcement | Activity logging |
| Proactive | Reactive |
| Sets the rules | Checks what happened |

Both are required for strong security posture.

Governance without audit = blind trust.  
Audit without governance = chaos documented perfectly.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

You must understand:

- Governance = risk management & policy enforcement
- Audit = logging & investigation
- Organizations must **both enforce controls and verify compliance**
- Microsoft provides tools across identity, data, and infrastructure

---

## 🧩 One-Line Summary

**Governance defines and enforces security and compliance rules, while auditing records and reviews activities to ensure accountability and regulatory compliance.**
