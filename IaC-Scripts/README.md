# 🧱 IaC-Scripts

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** scripts for automating Azure resource deployment, configuration, and management.  
This folder serves as a central hub for PowerShell, Bash, ARM, and comparison guides — each demonstrating different ways to build and manage Azure environments.

## 🧠 About This Folder

Each subfolder showcases a different approach or perspective on Azure automation:

| Folder | Tool / Purpose | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **PowerShell** | Az PowerShell module | Full automation and scripting control — ideal for administrators managing hybrid or Windows-heavy environments. |
| **Bash** | Azure CLI | Lightweight and cross-platform — perfect for quick deployments, scripting in Cloud Shell, or Linux-based workflows. |
| **ARM** | JSON templates | Declarative Infrastructure-as-Code for consistent, version-controlled deployments. |
| **Tools-Comparison** | Conceptual guides | Comparison and roadmap documents explaining how tools like PowerShell, Bash, ARM, Bicep, Terraform, and Copilot relate in the automation ecosystem. |

## 💡 Best Practices

- Keep scripts **modular**, **idempotent**, and easy to debug.  
- Include comments and clear parameter sections at the top of each file.  
- Use descriptive naming — e.g., `create-vmss.ps1` or `deploy-network-arm.json`.  
- Exclude credentials or secrets from the repository.  
- Commit after each verified deployment to maintain a clean and traceable history.
