# ‚öôÔ∏è Azure PowerShell Scripts Library

Welcome to the **PowerShell** section of my **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** collection.  
These scripts automate real-world Azure administration tasks ‚Äî from deploying VMs and Scale Sets to enabling autoscale, alerts, and monitoring dashboards.

Each script is self-contained, fully commented, and designed for hands-on learning or portfolio demonstration.

## üß≠ Recommended Learning Path

If you‚Äôre new to Azure scripting, follow this progression:

1. **Syntax ‚Üí** Start with `understanding-powershell-syntax.ps1`  
2. **Core Setup ‚Üí** Create resource groups, networks, and VMs  
3. **Compute Automation ‚Üí** Deploy and scale VMSS  
4. **Monitoring ‚Üí** Add alerts, diagnostics, and dashboards  
5. **Analysis ‚Üí** Query data in Log Analytics with KQL  

Each script builds upon the previous, mirroring a real Azure administrator workflow.

## üß© Skills Demonstrated

- Azure Resource Management (ARM) via PowerShell  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- VMSS scaling and autoscaling strategies  
- Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and KQL querying  
- DevOps-ready modular scripting practices  

---

## üí° Notes

- Run all scripts in **Azure Cloud Shell** or a **PowerShell session with Az module installed**.  
- Replace placeholders (e.g., `you@example.com`, region names, resource group names) with your own values.  
- Scripts are modular ‚Äî you can run them individually or chain them for full deployments.  
- Comments (`#` and `<# ... #>`) are detailed so the repo doubles as a learning guide.
