Explanation:

1. LOG ANALYTICS WORKSPACE
   - Central data store for Azure Monitor logs and metrics.
   - New-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace creates one if missing.
   - It stores metrics (CPU, memory, network) and platform logs.

2. DIAGNOSTIC SETTINGS
   - Set-AzDiagnosticSetting links your VMSS resource to the workspace.
   - Category "AllMetrics" forwards performance data continuously.

3. DASHBOARD
   - The ARM-style object defines a simple dashboard with a metric tile.
   - The tile shows Average CPU (%) for the VMSS.
   - You can later add more parts: Network In/Out, Disk Read/Write, Instance Count.

4. HOW TO VIEW
   - In Azure Portal: Dashboards â†’ "VMSS-Monitor-Dashboard"
   - Filter time range (last hour/day/week) to analyze load trends.

5. WHY THIS MATTERS
   - Together with alerts and autoscale, this completes the observability loop:
       * Log Analytics = storage and query
       * Alerts = proactive signals
       * Dashboard = visual context

6. NEXT STEPS (optional)
   - Enable VM insights: Enable-AzVMInsights -ResourceId $vmssId -WorkspaceId $ws.ResourceId
   - Query metrics: Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $vmssId
   - Visualize multi-resource dashboards or pin KQL charts from Log Analytics.

RESULT:
Your VMSS now continuously streams metrics to Log Analytics,
and you have a dashboard that displays its performance at a glance.
