# ☁️ Azure Zero to Hero — Azure Administration Portfolio  

## 🧭 Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on experience administering Microsoft Azure environments, with labs designed to reflect **real operational scenarios** encountered by cloud administrators and MSP teams.

All labs are **production-realistic**, reproducible, and cost-aware, built using my personal Azure subscription.  
Resources are **planned, deployed, validated, documented, and cleaned up** to mirror real-world cloud operations and cost controls.
