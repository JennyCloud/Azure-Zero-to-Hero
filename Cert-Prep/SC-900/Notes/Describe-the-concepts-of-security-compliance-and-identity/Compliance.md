# 🛡️ Compliance in Microsoft Cloud

## 🧠 What Is Compliance?

**Compliance** means meeting legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements for handling data.

In simple terms:

> Security protects data.  
> Compliance proves you’re protecting it correctly.

Compliance ensures that an organization follows:
- Laws (e.g., privacy laws)
- Industry regulations
- Internal corporate policies
- Contractual requirements

## ⚖️ Compliance vs Security

- **Security** = Preventing breaches and protecting systems
- **Compliance** = Demonstrating and validating that protections meet required standards

You can be secure but not compliant.
You cannot be compliant without security controls.
