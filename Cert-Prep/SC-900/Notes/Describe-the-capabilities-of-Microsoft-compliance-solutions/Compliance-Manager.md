# 📊 Microsoft Compliance Manager – Governance & Regulatory Tracking

## 🧠 Concept Overview

**Microsoft Compliance Manager** is a solution within **Microsoft Purview** that helps organizations:

- Assess regulatory compliance

## 🏛️ Where It Lives

Compliance Manager is part of:

**Microsoft Purview**

It supports regulations and standards such as:
- ISO 27001

- HIPAA
- SOC 2
- And many others

---

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1️⃣ Compliance Score
- A percentage-based score
- Reflects how many recommended controls are implemented
- Helps prioritize improvement actions

Higher score ≠ legally compliant  
It means more controls are implemented.

---

### 2️⃣ Improvement Actions
Compliance Manager provides:
- Recommended control actions
- Implementation guidance
- Evidence tracking
- Task assignment to users

These actions can be:
- Microsoft-managed (automated)
- Customer-managed (manual controls)

---

### 3️⃣ Assessments
You can create assessments based on:
- Built-in regulatory templates
- Custom regulatory requirements

Each assessment:
- Maps controls to requirements
- Tracks status
- Provides audit-ready documentation

---

### 4️⃣ Continuous Monitoring
Compliance is not a one-time event.

Compliance Manager:
- Updates automatically when Microsoft changes controls
- Tracks ongoing posture
- Helps prepare for audits

---

## 🔐 Shared Responsibility Angle

Compliance Manager reflects the **shared responsibility model**:

- Microsoft manages cloud infrastructure controls.
- Customers must implement organizational and configuration controls.

It clearly shows which controls are:
- Microsoft responsibility
- Customer responsibility
- Shared responsibility

---

## 🚫 What Compliance Manager Does NOT Do

- It does NOT guarantee regulatory compliance.
- It does NOT automatically pass audits.
- It does NOT replace legal counsel.

It is a management and tracking tool — not a compliance certification engine.
