# ‚öôÔ∏è Azure PowerShell Scripts Library

Welcome to the **PowerShell** section of my **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** collection.  
These scripts automate real-world Azure administration tasks ‚Äî from provisioning and scaling resources to securing, monitoring, and managing storage.

Each script is self-contained, fully commented, and designed for both **learning** and **practical use**.

## üß≠ Recommended Learning Path

If you‚Äôre learning PowerShell for Azure, follow this order for the smoothest progression:

1. **Syntax & Basics ‚Üí** `understanding-powershell-syntax.ps1`  
2. **Core Infrastructure ‚Üí** Resource Groups, Networks, and VMs  
3. **Compute Automation ‚Üí** VM Scale Sets and scaling policies  
4. **Monitoring & Observability ‚Üí** Alerts, Log Analytics, Dashboards, and KQL  
5. **Storage Mastery ‚Üí** Blob, File Share, and SAS management  

Each script builds on the last ‚Äî by the end, you‚Äôll have a complete, modular toolkit for Azure administration.

## üß© Skills Demonstrated

- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) automation via PowerShell  
- VMSS provisioning and scaling (manual + automatic)  
- Network and security configuration (VNet, NSG, Load Balancer)  
- Storage management (Blob, File Share, SAS, lifecycle)  
- Azure Monitor integration (alerts, dashboards, Log Analytics)  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and least-privilege principles  
- KQL analytics for performance insights  

---

## üí° Notes

- All scripts are safe to run in **Azure Cloud Shell** or **local PowerShell with the Az module** installed.  
- Replace placeholder values (e.g., resource group names, email addresses) with your own.  
- Each script includes detailed in-line comments (`#`) and full explanations in Markdown-style blocks (`<# ... #>`).  
- Modular design means you can use scripts individually or chain them in CI/CD workflows.
