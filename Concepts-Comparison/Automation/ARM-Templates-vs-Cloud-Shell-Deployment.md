# ARM Templates vs Cloud Shell Deployment

## ðŸ§­ Overview
Both **ARM templates** and **Cloud Shell (CLI / PowerShell)** can create resources in Azure, but they work in fundamentally different ways.  
Understanding the difference is key for **IaC**, automation, and efficient Azure management.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Difference: ARM Templates vs Cloud Shell
| **Aspect**                   | **Using ARM Templates**                                                                                                             | **Using Cloud Shell / CLI / PowerShell**                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | A **declarative approach**: you describe *what* resources you want and their configuration. Azure figures out *how* to create them. | An **imperative approach**: you tell Azure *exactly what commands* to run, step by step.      |
| **File Type**                | JSON (ARM template) or Bicep                                                                                                        | Scripts: PowerShell (`.ps1`) or CLI commands (`.azcli`)                                       |
| **Example**                  | "Create a VM named VM1 in East US with 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM."                                                                         | `az vm create --name VM1 --resource-group MyRG --size Standard_B2s --image Win2019Datacenter` |
| **Automation & Reusability** | Very high â€” the template can be stored in Git, versioned, and redeployed multiple times consistently.                               | Moderate â€” scripts can be reused but may require modification for each deployment.            |
| **Error Handling**           | Azure automatically resolves dependencies (e.g., storage account before VM).                                                        | You must ensure commands run in the correct order manually.                                   |
| **Best For**                 | Large environments, repeatable deployments, IaC, DevOps pipelines.                                                                  | Quick testing, one-off deployments, or when learning Azure commands.                          |

## âš¡ In Short

ARM Templates = Declarative, repeatable, version-controlled (focus on what the infrastructure should be).

Cloud Shell = Imperative, step-by-step scripting (focus on how to create it manually via commands).

Think of it like cooking:

ARM Template = give the recipe and ingredients, and the kitchen automatically makes the dish.

Cloud Shell = you personally chop, fry, and cook each step.
