# Azure Real-World Labs

## Overview
A collection of **hands-on Azure labs** designed around **real operational and application scenarios**, not exam-only demos.

The focus is on:
- Practical Azure administration and backend deployment
- Enterprise / MSP-style design patterns
- Secure, repeatable deployments
- Clear progression from scripting → IaC → CI/CD → application workloads

## Labs

- **Lab 01** — Hybrid Connectivity (PowerShell)  
- **Lab 02** — Load Balancing & High Availability (PowerShell)  
- **Lab 03** — VM Scale Sets & Autoscaling (PowerShell)  
- **Lab 04** — Private Endpoints & Private DNS (Bicep + GitHub Actions)  
- **Lab 05** — HelpHub: Cloud Backend & CI/CD (C#/.NET, SQL, Bicep, GitHub Actions)
