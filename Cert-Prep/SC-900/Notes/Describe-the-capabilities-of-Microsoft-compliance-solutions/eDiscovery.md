# 🔎 Microsoft eDiscovery

## 🧠 What is eDiscovery?

**eDiscovery (Electronic Discovery)** is the process of identifying, collecting, preserving, and exporting electronically stored information (ESI) for legal investigations, audits, or regulatory requests.

In Microsoft environments, eDiscovery is part of **Microsoft Purview**.

It helps organizations:
- Respond to lawsuits
- Handle internal investigations
- Meet regulatory requirements
- Preserve evidence without altering it

## ⚖️ Why eDiscovery Exists

When legal action or investigation happens, an organization must:

1. Locate relevant data  
2. Preserve it (so it cannot be deleted or altered)  
3. Review it  
4. Export it for legal use  

Failure to do this properly can result in fines, penalties, or legal damage.
