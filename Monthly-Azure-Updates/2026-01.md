This list is sequenced from **Most Critical** to **Least Critical** based on their impact on day-to-day administration.

### 1. [CRITICAL] Networking: StandardV2 SKU (Generally Available)
This is the highest priority because it replaces the previous performance ceiling for core networking resources.

* **Update:** StandardV2 SKU for NAT Gateway and Public IPs is now GA, supporting **100 Gbps** throughput and dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6).
* **Why it's #1:** Admins must now differentiate between Standard and StandardV2 in architectural decisions for high-traffic environments.

### 2. [HIGH] Storage: User Delegation SAS Expansion (Public Preview)
Crucial for security and "Least Privilege" governance.

* **Update:** User Delegation SAS (UDK) is now available for **Azure Tables, Files, and Queues** (previously only for Blobs).
* **Why it's #2:** It shifts the security model away from account keys to **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure AD) credentials for granular access.
* **Official Link:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=548987

### 3. [HIGH] Compute: Pod Security Standards in AKS (Generally Available)
Impacts the governance of Kubernetes workloads.

* **Update:** AKS now supports Pod Security Standards within **Deployment Safeguards** (Baseline, Restricted, Privileged).
* **Why it's #3:** It automates security enforcement at the cluster level, reducing the need for manual policy maintenance.

### 4. [MEDIUM] Compute: Ubuntu 24.04 and Containerd 2.0 (Generally Available)
Essential for lifecycle management and OS SKU selection.

* **Update:** Ubuntu 24.04 is now the GA baseline for AKS clusters (v1.32+), featuring **containerd 2.0**.
* **Why it's #4:** It becomes the default in Kubernetes 1.35; admins need to manage this transition during cluster upgrades.
* **Official Link:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=548096

### 5. [MEDIUM] Compute: 7th Gen Intel-based VMs (Public Preview)
Performance and cost-efficiency optimization.

* **Update:** Preview of **Dlsv7, Dsv7, and Esv7** series with Intel Xeon 6 processors and **Azure Boost** integration.
* **Why it's #5:** Offers a 15% performance gain; critical for right-sizing enterprise workloads.
* **Official Link:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=529407

### 6. [LOW] Governance: Azure Monitor VM Data Collection (Retirement Notice)
Long-term planning update.

* **Update:** The preview feature *"Send VM client data to Event Hubs and Storage"* retires on **July 31, 2026**.
* **Why it's #6:** While important for migration, it has the longest lead time and affects a specific preview feature rather than GA infrastructure.
* **Official Link:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=551523

### 7. [LOW] Compute: Python 3.10 in Azure Functions (Retirement Notice)
App-specific lifecycle management.

* **Update:** Support for **Python 3.10** ends on **October 1, 2026**.
* **Why it's #7:** Primarily impacts developers, but admins must coordinate the upgrade to Python 3.13.
