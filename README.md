# ☁️ Azure Zero to Hero — Learning Portfolio  

## 🧭 Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Microsoft Azure — building and managing real-world environments like a **cloud engineer**.

Labs are designed to be **production-realistic**, reproducible, and cost-aware, and are built using my personal Microsoft Azure account.  
Resources are **created, validated, documented, and then cleaned up** to avoid unnecessary cloud costs.
